Create a chat client and server:

Client:
 - first will ask the user for his name and will use it from this time on
 - the chat window will be scrolled
 - the text input will send the text on ENTER (Google it)

Server:
 - the chat server will assign color to each user
 - the chat server will assign date to each message
 - the chat server will hold the all chat history, and when the user will connect he will get the all history
   (since the server is up)
